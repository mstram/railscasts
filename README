= Railscasts

This is a rewrite of the Railscasts site (http://railscasts.com).

Please let me know if you plan to use this app for your site.


== Setup

Run "script/setup". This will generate the config files, install gems,
and migrate the database.

Run "script/setup_test" if you want to run the tests. This will install
the RSpec plugins and some other gems required for testing.

You may want to install sphinx, run the index and start rake commands,
and set thinking_sphinx:true in app_config.yml. This isn't required as
it will default to a primitive search.
